  "llm_interpretation_guide": "This document is a token-efficient representation of a codebase. Interpret it as follows:\n\n- HIERARCHY: Indentation represents the directory structure.\n- DIRECTORIES: A line ending with a forward slash `/` is a directory.\n- FILES: A line not ending in a slash is a file within the directory defined by its indentation level.\n- FILE CONTENT:\n  - Textual content for a file is enclosed between `---[FILE_CONTENT]---` markers that appear on the lines immediately following the filename.\n  - The content has been processed to remove comments and reduce whitespace.\n- SPECIAL FILE TAGS: Some files are represented by a single-line tag on the line after the filename:\n  - `[SUMMARY_JSON] {\"key\":\"value\",...}`: A compact, single-line JSON summary of a configuration file (e.g., package.json).\n  - `[BINARY]`: A binary file whose content is not included.\n  - `[IGNORED]`: File was ignored due to filtering rules (e.g., minified file, lock file, SVG).\n  - `[ERROR] message...`: An error occurred while reading or processing the file."
